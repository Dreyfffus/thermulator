# Test Plan

## 1. Setup and familiarization

- Objective: verify the workspace builds and ROS environment is sourced.
- Command: `colcon build --packages-select my_tb3_world thermocator --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`
- Expected topics/nodes: build artifacts for both packages.
- Pass condition: build succeeds and `source install/setup.bash` exposes the packages.
- Current status: partially implemented.

## 2. Gazebo and RViz simulation

- Objective: launch TurtleBot3 in the custom Gazebo world and optionally inspect in RViz.
- Command: `ros2 launch my_tb3_world sim_with_bridge.launch.py use_sim_time:=true`
- Expected topics/nodes: Gazebo process, `ros_gz_parameter_bridge`, `/clock`.
- Pass condition: Gazebo opens, robot spawns, `/clock` is visible in ROS.
- Current status: implemented, untested.

## 3. Simulated movement and sensors

- Objective: verify simulated motion and sensor output.
- Command: `ros2 topic echo /scan --once` and `ros2 topic echo /odom --once`
- Expected topics/nodes: `/scan`, `/odom`, `/tf`.
- Pass condition: scan and odometry messages are received while Gazebo is running.
- Current status: partially implemented, untested.

## 4. DT mediator / fan-in-fan-out

- Objective: verify original project streams are mirrored into `/dt/*`.
- Command: `ros2 launch thermocator dt_integration.launch.py use_sim_time:=true`
- Expected topics/nodes: `dt_mediator`, `/dt/odom`, `/dt/scan`, `/dt/map`, `/dt/thermal_map`, `/dt/thermal_reading`.
- Pass condition: `/dt/*` topics appear and receive messages when source topics are active.
- Current status: implemented, untested.

## 5. Bridged Gazebo stream

- Objective: verify at least one ROS/Gazebo bridged stream.
- Command: `ros2 topic echo /clock --once`
- Expected topics/nodes: `/clock` from Gazebo through `ros_gz_bridge`.
- Pass condition: `/clock` publishes while Gazebo is running.
- Current status: implemented, untested.

## 6. Bidirectional communication

- Objective: verify command flow from DT interface to robot/simulation command topic.
- Command: `ros2 topic pub --once /dt/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.05}, angular: {z: 0.0}}"`
- Expected topics/nodes: `dt_mediator`, `/dt/cmd_vel`, `/cmd_vel`.
- Pass condition: `/cmd_vel` receives the forwarded `geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped` command and the robot moves if the simulator accepts `/cmd_vel`.
- Current status: implemented, untested.

## 7. Real-time synchronization and tolerance

- Objective: measure delay between original and `/dt/*` streams.
- Command: `ros2 launch thermocator dt_integration.launch.py sync_tolerance_seconds:=0.5`
- Expected topics/nodes: `sync_monitor`.
- Pass condition: sync monitor prints `Sync ok` for active mirrored stream pairs, or warns when delay exceeds tolerance.
- Current status: implemented, untested.

## 8. Obstacle detection and avoidance

- Objective: verify Nav2 uses `/scan` and avoids Gazebo obstacles.
- Command: `ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=true params_file:=/ws/src/thermocator/config/nav2_thermal_params.yaml`
- Expected topics/nodes: Nav2 lifecycle nodes, costmaps, `/scan`.
- Pass condition: robot plans around obstacles in the custom world.
- Current status: partially implemented, untested.

## 9. Object interaction / simplified equivalent

- Objective: satisfy the interaction requirement with a project-specific simplification.
- Command: run Gazebo, Nav2, and DT integration, then send or select a thermal target goal.
- Expected topics/nodes: `/scan`, Nav2 costmaps, `/thermal_map`, `decision_node`.
- Pass condition: TurtleBot3 detects boxes/obstacles through `/scan`, avoids them with Nav2, and treats thermal hotspot/environment state as the object/state of interest.
- Current status: limitation, documented simplified equivalent.

## 10. Scenario testing

- Objective: run a repeatable scenario with Gazebo, bridge, Nav2, thermal mapping, mediator, and sync monitor.
- Command: follow `docs/demo_checklist.md`.
- Expected topics/nodes: Gazebo, bridge, Nav2, thermal nodes, DT mediator, sync monitor.
- Pass condition: all required topics are active, `/dt/cmd_vel` forwards, thermal map publishes, and sync monitor reports health.
- Current status: implemented as checklist, untested.

## 11. Final demo preparation

- Objective: provide a clear final demonstration sequence.
- Command: follow `docs/demo_checklist.md`.
- Expected topics/nodes: all demo nodes and `/dt/*` topics.
- Pass condition: demonstration can be repeated from clean terminals.
- Current status: implemented as documentation, untested.
